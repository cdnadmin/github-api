## Readme for Monico Moreno Github Api (mmga) Project

Quick note, I'll be working on this in 15-30-minute bursts due to my schedule this week, of Sept 1, 2014.


### Tools, Packages, etc.
* Mac OS X Mavs
* Google Chrome Dev Tools
* Sublime Text 2
* NodeJs 0.10.29
* Express 4.2.0
* Express Generator 4.2.0
  --Note this defaults to jade as template, but reset to use ejs instead; matter of pref.
* Google Chrome Advanced REST Client -- for testing RESTful API
* github-api node package.
* mongodb nodejs driver


### Comments
Aside from auto-generated deliverables (e.g. express-generator files), all source was hand coded by Monico.
